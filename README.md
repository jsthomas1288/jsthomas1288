Hello there 👋 

I wanted to help you get to know me better! 😁

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in the MERN stack, Nuxt, and TypeScript.
I have a passion for building responsive, user-focused web applications and websites. Also, I combine a strong technical background in engineering and mathematics with a creative, people-first approach to development. I'm open to full-time remote or hybrid roles where I can grow, contribute, and serve with excellence. 

Here are some other important highlights about me:

➡️ Christian ✝️

➡️ Family comes first 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🏡

➡️ Crazy, yet super cool, uncle to three kiddos 👧👦

➡️ Current soccer player (only recreationally...and seasonally) ⚽️

➡️ Dreamer - Team Player - Innovator

➡️ Health enthusiast 🏃💨🏋️

➡️ Nature/Outdoor advocate 🏖🏞🏕✈️

One of my main goals in life is to reach financial independence so that I can spend more time helping/serving others around me. 

Two main phrases I typically dwell on are "Enjoy the small things" and "Pay it forward." 💭
