Hello there 👋 

I wanted to take the time to help you get to know me better! 😁

I'm a Front End Developer experienced in building highly responsive websites and holding a strong background in engineering and mathematics.

Here are some other important highlights about me:

➡️ Christian ✝️

➡️ Family comes first 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🏡

➡️ Crazy, yet super cool, uncle to two kiddos and one dog! 👧👦🦮

➡️ Current soccer player (only recreationally...and seasonally) ⚽️

➡️ Dreamer - Team Player - Innovator

➡️ Health enthusiast 🏃💨🏋️

➡️ Nature/Outdoor advocate 🏖🏞🏕✈️

One of my main goals in life is to reach financial independence so that I can spend more time helping/serving others around me. 

Two main phrases I typically dwell on are "Enjoy the small things" and "Pay it forward." 💭

Please feel free to reach out or connect with me about anything as I do my best to always keep an open door and an open mind 😁
